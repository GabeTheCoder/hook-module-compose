# Hook Module Compose

## Installation

I said this was a WIP. You're a rebel. I like it. Run `npm install --save hook-module-compose` and add this line to your `package.json` scripts.

```
"scaffold": "npm explore hook-module-compose -- npm run scaffold"
```

## Usage

```
npm --name=YourShittyComponentName run scaffold
```
